# Summer-2017--Physics-Research

This report is a summary of the work that I have done and the material I have learnt during the Summer of 2017. I worked with the Rutgers Relativistic Heavy Ion group under Dr. Sevil Salur and under the mentorship of PhD candidate Raghav Kunnawalkam Elayavalli. The aim of my project was to analyse jets and their various properties using Rivet. The events being analysed in this paper are Monte Carlo generated, either locally, or as batch jobs on lxplus at CERN. Using these analyses, my task at hand was to create graphs to realize the data and make predictions for the upcoming sPHENIX project.

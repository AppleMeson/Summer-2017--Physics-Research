delphitest----> Ananlysis of Jet Observeables such as Iaa(not actual), delta phi, Aj(assymetry), JetpT, an Fragmentation function(Z)

Iaa can be made by running this analysis on both pp and Au+Au and getting the ratio plot.

fragmentation----> Analysis of staple jet and track observables along with fragmentation function, with a delta R cut of 4 using built in function===> deltaR(eta1, phi1, eta2, phi2).
